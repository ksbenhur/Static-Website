    Front-end web development, also known as client-side web development is the practise of producing
    HTML, CSS, and Javascript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact
    with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and
    techniques used to create the front end of the website change constantly and so the developer
    needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.

    The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the
    information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact
    that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus
    forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need
    to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers(cross-browser), different
    operating systems(cross-platforms) and different devices(cross-device), which requires careful
    planning on the side of the developer.
